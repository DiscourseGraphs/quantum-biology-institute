# Description and Key Plot(s)

Observed so far in [eln-ecoli-growth-curves](../../ecoli_growth_curves/1_eln_ecoli_growth_curves/eln-ecoli-growth-curves.md) 6/25

But in 7/1 we saw that [EVD - Stationary phase E coli showed no difference in growth rate under hypomagnetic conditions](EVD%20-%20Stationary%20phase%20E%20coli%20showed%20no%20difference%20in%20growth%20rate%20under%20hypomagnetic%20conditions.md)

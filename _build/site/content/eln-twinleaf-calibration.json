While Btot doesn’t seem to change much and looks like it gets even better, the values of Bx, By and Bz are a bit all over the place and change quite a bit. This is most likely due to the fact that the twinleaf has a pretty tight fit and mechanical stress can induce slight changes in the materials’ magnetization. On top of this, removing the internal caps of the twinleaf exposes them to Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in a partial magnetization of the material. In the large hypomagnetic chamber, the change in residual magnetic field is usually pretty consistent and not drastic - I imagine that being due to the door being fixed on a hinge with a fixed path and no mechanical stress.

Once we know the offset, we can take that into account in our measurement and we will know the value of the residual field with a much better accuracy. However, this all relies on the true residual field being constant, which is not really the case for the twinleaf. My first line of thinking here was to jus perform a degaussing each time I flip the magnetometer, but when I tried to do that (even without flipping the quspin) it gave me a residual field value that was wildly different from the one I got before. I did a bunch of tests but I cannot seem to find a solution that gives me a stable enough value of the field to perform a good offset calibration. My current idea is to just use active compensation to get as close to zero as possible in the measured field (meaning we will settle around the intrinsic offset of the magnetometer, being between 2 and 5 nT). That is probably good enough for the experiments we want to perform in Maryland - to be fair, most hypomagnetic experiments I have seen recently have residual fields that go from 30 nT at the lowest to about 1 uT, meaning that the residual value would be still many times lower than the average hypomagnetic experiment. However, I will still do some tests and figure out if I can find a better solution for this.","position":{"start":{"line":49,"column":1},"end":{"line":49,"column":1}},"key":"ue2DprGV8j"}],"key":"uB4cSvwUJh"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":51,"column":1},"end":{"line":51,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Another consideration is that ideally we might want to leave the quspin inside of the twinleaf all the time to get an active feedback.

This would likely create a temperature difference with respect to a control.. not good. At the same time, you wouldn’t need to leave the quspin on all the time so you could just think of adjusting the active compensation whenever the twinleaf is opened and closed and then immediately turning the quspin off. If we want to really minimize the field, this might be the way to go.

This is because the amount of current required is extremely low and to achieve that, the voltage required is also very low. This means that just barely touching the dial creates nT differences in residual field. For this reason, it might be a good idea to add some resistors to the line.

I decided to create some sensors with things that were already in the lab and that I could repurpose for this specific task. I played around with some sensors in the past and I had a pair of temperature and humidity sensors (Adafruit HTU21DF) as well as a pair of light sensors (Adafruit VEML7700). Having sensors that are exactly the same is very important here because we want to measurement to be as consistent as possible in the two environments. Also, it is very important for the measurement to be simultaneous and not sequential (meaning calibrating the environments at the same time and not one before the other). Now, understanding these requirements, we can come up with a simple setup that gathers data from the sensors every x amount of time (where x can be decided). However, this requires other hardware components to be able to read the data from the sensors and also some coding to read the data as well as store it in a good format and eventually plotting it. These sensors can be hooked up to an Arduino board, probably the most popular microcontroller on the market for DIY projects. This is connected to a PC via USB cable, which also serves as power source. Now, if we had one set of different sensors, we could just connect all of them to the Arduino directly. However, in our case we have two sets of sensors that are exactly the same. This creates a conflict in the way Arduino interacts with the sensors, creating the need for another hardware component: a multiplexer. Quick description of how this works: the Arduino uses two lines to communicate with the sensors, SDA (data) and SCL (clock). Each type of sensor has a unique address, so that the Arduino knows what kind of sensor it is talking to. The same sensor has the same address and the Arduino gets confused if there is more than one connected, resulting in the inability to read any data. This is the reason we use a multiplexer, which is a piece of hardware whose function is to basically split the SDA and SCL signal in a bunch of independent SDA and SCL channels that can be addressed sequentially. What this means is that, if we use a multiplexer, we can establish a connection with only one set of sensors at a time, ultimately resolving the conflict of calling an overrepresented address. This is the way the communication between the sensor and Arduino works in the calibration setup. Apart from these connections, the sensors and multiplexer need to be powered up, and this can be done via pins in the Arduino corresponding to some amount of voltage and some connected to ground. In particular, the sensors are powered up with 3.3 V and the multiplexer with 5 V. Here is the scheme for the electrical connections that need to happen in the setup.","position":{"start":{"line":65,"column":1},"end":{"line":65,"column":1}},"key":"kmyrW5NQ95"}],"key":"HjEB6F93Lk"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":67,"column":1},"end":{"line":67,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"![[image1.png]]","position":{"start":{"line":67,"column":1},"end":{"line":67,"column":1}},"key":"OBhHDc325W"}],"key":"XeAFYIJ0mR"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":69,"column":1},"end":{"line":69,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I went on and created some cables to make these connections as easy and straight forward as possible.

I gotta be honest, sometimes it just makes some dumb mistakes or it structures the thing in a way that is far from optimized, but for some simple tasks like this it works very well and it saves you from the hustle of actually writing the code and having to remember the syntax. It is always good to go through the code and understand how it was set up, but it is by far a much more optimized option. Having said that here are the codes that I used to make this setup work.","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":1},"end":{"line":79,"column":1}},"key":"tGKZRZVBE9"}],"key":"VXXLfBPbh1"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":1},"end":{"line":81,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Arduino code: ![[arduino_sensor_reading.ino]]","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":1},"end":{"line":81,"column":1}},"key":"Nokd1auyXQ"}],"key":"zsQp5FQlLA"},{"type":"code","lang":"arduino","value":"#include <Wire.h>\n#include \"Adafruit_VEML7700.h\"\n#include \"Adafruit_HTU21DF.h\"\n\n#define TCAADDR 0x70  // I2C address of PCA9548A\n\nAdafruit_VEML7700 veml = Adafruit_VEML7700();\nAdafruit_HTU21DF htu = Adafruit_HTU21DF();\n\nvoid tcaSelect(uint8_t channel) {\n  if (channel > 7) return;\n  Wire.beginTransmission(TCAADDR);\n  Wire.write(1 << channel);  // Select channel\n  Wire.endTransmission();\n}\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  Wire.begin();\n\n  delay(2000);  // Let Serial initialize\n  Serial.println(\"Setup complete.

The thing that changes the most is the light condition, but I think that is because the sensors were not fixed in place and the light sensors were oriented a bit differently, making one more sensitive to environmental light than the other. The behavior might look weird but it does make sense. Note that the measurement covers multiple days — it’s easy to see when it was daytime by the high values of light. You can also observe that temperature tends to be higher during the day and lower at night. Also, the zigzag pattern is caused by the HVAC system. The way we have it set up at the moment works in the following way: if temperature gets too cold the heat will be activated to get above a threshold value (this is what happens at night); if the temperature is too high the AC will be activated to get temperature below a certain threshold (this is what happens during the day). It is actually interesting to notice that cooling (AC) has a much higher impact on humidity than heating, as you can observe by the difference in the height of the zigzag pattern between the heating and cooling process.

I made sure all the necessary libraries were installed and I showed him how to run the calibration for temperature, humidity and light as well as how to set up the wiring for the sensors. On top of this, we tried reproducing Earth’s field inside of the Twinleaf, but we encountered some technical difficulties when trying to read the magnetic field. My idea was to use a cellphone: there is a pretty cool app called physics toolbox that allows you to read a bunch of parameters with your phone’s sensors, including magnetic fields. Since it works pretty well in Earth’s field range, I though it would be a decent, zero cost way of reading the field inside and outside of the Twinleaf. I had Mike download the app and it turns out that his phone reads a different value with respect to mine. Also, the readings don’t seem to be very consistent, so we decided to find an alternative and cleaner solution for that purpose.

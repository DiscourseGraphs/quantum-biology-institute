title: PRJ - Multi-omics of magnetosensitivity in microbial model organisms
---

# Motivation and Scientific Goals
Michael Montague is leading an effort out of the Craig J. Venter Institute in Maryland to study the multi-omics of magnetosensitivity in microbial model organisms.

## Why microbes?
- Microbes are EASY to grow.
	- Not encumbered with ethics concerns… nobody cares about the pain and suffering of bacteria.
	- Microbes generally grow on cheap media.
	- Microbes grow quickly… visible colonies in days from individual cells.
- Microbes are well understood and well studied:
	- Genomes fully sequenced, relatively well annotated, and have a wide variety of existing publicly available omics datasets provide lots of context.
	- Genetic tools well established.  (That means it is possible to insert, delete, or alter targeted individual genes or groups of genes).
	- Relatively simple.
	- Immediate industrial and biomedical implications.
- Microbes have universal relevance to the community of biologists.  Even if a biologist studies cancer in mice, he likely uses microbes as part of his laboratory set-up.  By demonstrating magneto-sensitivity in microbes very few biologists will be able to afford to ignore the results.

## What microbes are we starting with?
- E.coli K12 (gram negative: Bacteria)
- B. subtilis (gram positive: Bacteria)
- S.cerevisiea (yeast: Eukaryote)
- H. volcanii (Achaea)
- Between them they represent all three domains of cellular life, and both of the major divisions of the Bacteria kingdom.  They are well established and heavily studied lab strains that are NOT specifically selected for magnetic sensitivity.

## Why multi-omics?
- Multi-omics should be thought of as an alternative to the ‘quantum microscope’ that the California team is centering its studies upon.  It is a collection of techniques that provide read-outs that can be mapped onto the genome or genes of an organism and thus onto the functional properties of the organism.
	- For example: you might stress an organism with heat, then ask which genes of the organism are turned on and which are turned off in response to the heat?  Each of the many thousands of genes of that organism can now be, in a way, a sensor telling you about the response to heat.  Individually no one of them is likely to reveal much, but collectively they allow for recognizable signatures.  Perhaps the collection genes turned on and off by heat resembles the collection of genes turned on and off by oxidative stress for example.
- The alteration of biological characteristics by variable magnetic field conditions represents a kind of stress that can be imposed upon cells with omics as a read-out.
- The initial omics probe will be transcriptiomics.  Transcriptomics is a way of asking which genes are turned on and off at the mRNA transcription level of gene expression.  This is almost the earliest step in the gene regulation and activation process in cells.  Because it is early in the process of production of final gene products and realization of their functions, it does not capture all of the complexities of a gene’s regulatory state and responses to stimuli.  However, because it functions via DNA sequencing, it is cheap and easy to perform.  Subsequent studies will study the proteomics of magnetic field environment.

## What is our immediate goal? 
  
Using fast organisms and fast transcriptomics assays from kits, we hope to have definitive proof that ALL life responds to magnetic fields.  By doing this with organisms that are NOT specifically selected for magneto-responsiveness, and which have been used in laboratories the world over for decades and which span the genetic diversity of all cellular life, it will be reasonable to to not just contend that magnetic response is very common, but alternatively that non-response actually NEVER happens.  **It switches the burden of proof to what is now still the null-hypothesis.**

# What we are learning (so far)

Based on our work [calibrating the Twinleaf for use in the Maryland lab](twinleaf_calibration/1_eln_twinleaf_calibration/eln-twinleaf-calibration.md), we've established that the degaussing procedure is extremely effective in reducing the residual magnetic field.

And based on our ongoing tests on [growth curve responses to hypomagnetic conditions E.coli](ecoli_growth_curves/1_eln_ecoli_growth_curves/eln-ecoli-growth-curves.md), with our first model microbe, we've established that:
- [EVD - 6-20 hypomagnetic conditions lengthened the lag phase of growing E. coli](results/discourse_graph/EVD%20-%206-20%20hypomagnetic%20conditions%20lengthened%20the%20lag%20phase%20of%20growing%20E.%20coli.md)
It doesn't seem like the effect was influenced by the following conditions:
* light/dark
* polarity of magnet
* air availability (sealed vs gas exchange)

One time, when grown from stationary phase (very high OD): [EVD - Stationary phase E coli showed no difference in growth rate under hypomagnetic conditions](results/discourse_graph/EVD%20-%20Stationary%20phase%20E%20coli%20showed%20no%20difference%20in%20growth%20rate%20under%20hypomagnetic%20conditions.md)
